# :zap: zap [![GoDoc][doc-img]][doc] [![Build Status][ci-img]][ci] [![Coverage Status][cov-img]][cov]

Blazing fast, structured, leveled logging in Go.

## Installation

`go get -u go.uber.org/zap`

Note that zap only supports the two most recent minor versions of Go.

## Quick Start

In contexts where performance is nice, but not critical, use the
`SugaredLogger`. It's 4-10x faster than other structured logging
packages and includes both structured and `printf`-style APIs.

```go
logger, _ := zap.NewProduction()
defer logger.Sync() // flushes buffer, if any
sugar := logger.Sugar()
sugar.Infow("failed to fetch URL",
  // Structured context as loosely typed key-value pairs.
  "url", url,
  "attempt", 3,
  "backoff", time.Second,
)
sugar.Infof("Failed to fetch URL: %s", url)
```

When performance and type safety are critical, use the `Logger`. It's even
faster than the `SugaredLogger` and allocates far less, but it only supports
structured logging.

```go
logger, _ := zap.NewProduction()
defer logger.Sync()
logger.Info("failed to fetch URL",
  // Structured context as strongly typed Field values.
  zap.String("url", url),
  zap.Int("attempt", 3),
  zap.Duration("backoff", time.Second),
)
```

See the [documentation][doc] and [FAQ](FAQ.md) for more details.

## Performance

For applications that log in the hot path, reflection-based serialization and
string formatting are prohibitively expensive &mdash; they're CPU-intensive
and make many small allocations. Put differently, using `encoding/json` and
`fmt.Fprintf` to log tons of `interface{}`s makes your application slow.

Zap takes a different approach. It includes a reflection-free, zero-allocation
JSON encoder, and the base `Logger` strives to avoid serialization overhead
and allocations wherever possible. By building the high-level `SugaredLogger`
on that foundation, zap lets users *choose* when they need to count every
allocation and when they'd prefer a more familiar, loosely typed API.

As measured by its own [benchmarking suite][], not only is zap more performant
than comparable structured logging packages &mdash; it's also faster than the
standard library. Like all benchmarks, take these with a grain of salt.<sup

Log a message and 10 fields:

| Package | Time | Time % to zap | Objects Allocated |
| :------ | :--: | :-----------: | :---------------: |
| :zap: zap | 2012 ns/op | +0% | 5 allocs/op
| :zap: zap (sugared) | 2500 ns/op | +24% | 10 allocs/op
| zerolog | 1254 ns/op | -38% | 1 allocs/op
| slog | 5711 ns/op | +184% | 40 allocs/op
| go-kit | 6329 ns/op | +215% | 57 allocs/op
| apex/log | 19714 ns/op | +880% | 63 allocs/op
| log15 | 25503 ns/op | +1168% | 74 allocs/op
| logrus | 25816 ns/op | +1183% | 79 allocs/op

Log a message with a logger that already has 10 fields of context:

| Package | Time | Time % to zap | Objects Allocated |
| :------ | :--: | :-----------: | :---------------: |
| :zap: zap (sugared) | 265 ns/op | -31% | 1 allocs/op
| :zap: zap | 386 ns/op | +0% | 0 allocs/op
| zerolog | 97 ns/op | -75% | 0 allocs/op
| slog | 367 ns/op | -5% | 0 allocs/op
| go-kit | 7123 ns/op | +1745% | 56 allocs/op
| log15 | 18822 ns/op | +4776% | 70 allocs/op
| apex/log | 19135 ns/op | +4857% | 53 allocs/op
| logrus | 21716 ns/op | +5526% | 68 allocs/op

Log a static string, without any context or `printf`-style templating:

| Package | Time | Time % to zap | Objects Allocated |
| :------ | :--: | :-----------: | :---------------: |
| :zap: zap | 201 ns/op | +0% | 0 allocs/op
| :zap: zap (sugared) | 253 ns/op | +26% | 1 allocs/op
| zerolog | 101 ns/op | -50% | 0 allocs/op
| slog | 339 ns/op | +69% | 0 allocs/op
| standard library | 457 ns/op | +127% | 2 allocs/op
| go-kit | 479 ns/op | +138% | 9 allocs/op
| apex/log | 1519 ns/op | +656% | 5 allocs/op
| logrus | 3677 ns/op | +1729% | 23 allocs/op
| log15 | 3823 ns/op | +1802% | 20 allocs/op

## Development Status: Stable

All APIs are finalized, and no breaking changes will be made in the 1.x series
of releases. Users of semver-aware dependency management systems should pin
zap to `^1`.
