Blazing fast, structured, leveled logging in Go.

## Installation

`go get -u go.uber.org/zap`

## Quick Start

In contexts where performance is nice, but not critical, use the
`SugaredLogger`. It's 4-10x faster than than other structured logging libraries
and includes both structured and `printf`-style APIs.

```go
logger, _ := NewProduction()
sugar := logger.Sugar()
sugar.Infow("Failed to fetch URL.",
  // Structured context as loosely-typed key-value pairs.
  "url", url,
  "attempt", retryNum,
  "backoff", time.Second,
)
sugar.Infof("Failed to fetch URL: %s", url)
```

When performance and type safety are critical, use the `Logger`. It's even faster than
the `SugaredLogger` and allocates far less, but it only supports structured logging.

```go
logger, _ := NewProduction()
logger.Info("Failed to fetch URL.",
  // Structured context as strongly-typed Field values.
  zap.String("url", url),
  zap.Int("attempt", tryNum),
  zap.Duration("backoff", time.Second),
)
```

## Development Status: Release Candidate 1
The current release is `v1.0.0-rc.2`. No further breaking changes are *planned*
unless wider use reveals critical bugs or usability issues, but users who need
absolute stability should wait for the 1.0.0 release.

## Performance

For applications that log in the hot path, reflection-based serialization and
string formatting are prohibitively expensive &mdash; they're CPU-intensive and
make many small allocations. Put differently, using `encoding/json` and
`fmt.Fprintf` to log tons of `interface{}`s makes your application slow.

Zap takes a different approach. It includes a reflection-free, zero-allocation
JSON encoder, and the base `Logger` strives to avoid serialization overhead and
allocations wherever possible. By building the high-level `SugaredLogger` on
that foundation, zap lets users *choose* when they need to count every
allocation and when they'd prefer a more familiar, loosely-typed API.

As measured by its own [benchmarking suite][], not only is zap more performant
than comparable structured logging libraries &mdash; it's also faster than the
standard library. Like all benchmarks, take these with a grain of salt.<sup

### Benchmarks

Log a message and 10 fields:

| Library | Time | Bytes Allocated | Objects Allocated |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|:zap: zap|       826 ns/op|     706 B/op|       2 allocs/op|
|:zap: zap (sugared)|      1340 ns/op|    1614 B/op|      20 allocs/op|
|logrus|      5340 ns/op|    6103 B/op|      78 allocs/op|

|lion|      4694 ns/op|    5812 B/op|      63 allocs/op|

Log a message with a logger that already has 10 fields of context:

| Library | Time | Bytes Allocated | Objects Allocated |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|:zap: zap|       279 ns/op|       0 B/op|       0 allocs/op|
|:zap: zap (sugared)|       370 ns/op|      80 B/op|       2 allocs/op|
|logrus|      4595 ns/op|    4569 B/op|      63 allocs/op|
|go-kit|      3607 ns/op|    3048 B/op|      52 allocs/op|
|log15|     13805 ns/op|    2643 B/op|      44 allocs/op|
|apex/log|     13650 ns/op|    2899 B/op|      51 allocs/op|
|lion|      3100 ns/op|    4077 B/op|      38 allocs/op|

Log a static string, without any context or `printf`-style templating:

| Library | Time | Bytes Allocated | Objects Allocated |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|:zap: zap|       262 ns/op|       0 B/op|       0 allocs/op|
|:zap: zap (sugared)|       344 ns/op|      80 B/op|       2 allocs/op|
|standard library|       499 ns/op|      80 B/op|       2 allocs/op|
|logrus|      1361 ns/op|    1507 B/op|      27 allocs/op|
